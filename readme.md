# Day 15 of My 3 Weeks Game Challenge

It's my friend's daughter's birthday today and I just wanted to make her a surprise game. Well, this is the most birthday themed game I could come up with.

Balloon pop is a nice little game... And you can find 20 more games on [my challenge repo](https://github.com/zsoltime/game-challenge).

## User Stories

- [ ] There are different levels and the game is getting more and more difficult by reaching higher levels

## Next Steps

I wish I could draw better balloons. It would look better with a curvy line and the highlight should be rotated. I tried the `rotate()` function, but its origin was the original position, I think. I still don't know if it's possible to set transform origin in p5.js.

It was the most difficult game so far, mostly because I have never used the HTML5 canvas or the [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js) library before.

I'd like to thank [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman) for making those lovely [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw). He's the only reason I started developing this game in p5.js.
