# Day 15 of My 3 Weeks Game Challenge

It's my friend's daughter's birthday today and I just wanted to make her a surprise game. Well, this is the most birthday themed game I could come up with.

Balloon pop is a nice little game...

## Next Steps

I wish I could draw better balloons. It would look better with a curvy line and the highlight should be rotated. I tried the `rotate()` function, but its origin was the original position, I think. I still don't know if it's possible to set transform origin in p5.js.

It was the most difficult game so far, mostly because I have never used the HTML5 canvas or the p5.js library before.
